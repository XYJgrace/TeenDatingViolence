    <h3>Why this matters</a></h3>
    <p>Every young person deserves a safe and healthy relationship with their partner, if they choose to have one. Yet, it is evident that many young people, students and teenagers, experience some form of abuse, whether it's physical, verbal, or emotional. Many don't have access or know how to access legal protection/assistance in leaving an abusive relationship, while adults and caretakers are not prepared to address these incidents either.</p>
    
    <p>The effects of dating violence are severe, especially to teens. Academics, health, teen pregnancy, isolation, and sexual assault are just a few of the consequences that affect not only the victim but also their communities. Teenagers need to be able to recognize a harmful relationship; conversations on these issues need to be normalized; adults need to be prepared to address these incidents; <b>TDV need to stop</b>.</p>
